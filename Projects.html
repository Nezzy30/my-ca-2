            <h3>Project 1: Art (Visual Art and Literary art)</h3>
            <p>I used to specialise in both batches of art, but I took a pause on visual art and I hope to return back to it after I improve my skill in that aspect of art now that I am in university and may have some little difficulties being dedicated with it but it would resume in the summer by then my skills would have improved a lot better. But for now my services would focus more on literary art (poetry). If you ever want me to come up with a poem for your special person I would be happy to help put some smiles on the faces of you and your loved ones with the amazing poems I write. So if you ever want a poem written for you, you can contact me by filling this <a href="./contact.html">form.</a> You can see a poem I made for the executive director of my secondary school and my sixth form in the bottom.
            <br>

            I know I said I am taking a pause on my work on visual art but here are 3 main art works that I have done in the past, focusing more on work I did about 7 years ago. In the left is "Bird in a Colourful World" which is mainly a paper collage, however, I used water colour paint for the toucan bird itself.
            <br>
            <br>
            On the top-right is Expression and it was made with NATARAJ posterpaint and is an african motif. I fermented colours wit water.

            <br>
            The last but not certainly the least is "The Beady Pot", this calabash, which I decorated with beads. A fun-fact about this art-work was that a lot of people were trying to buy it and I didn't think my work was good but ther were a lot of people that saw things I didn't about my own artwork which is strange but I am still thankful. This piece of art even won me a contract to make 10 for them. I am thankful to God for these opportunities.

            <h3>Project 2: Community Service Project (CSP)</h3>
            <p>Another project, I am involved in, is the community service project club in my university. I have been an active member since I joined the group and have been rewarded with a certificate and crowned the deputy head of the sports department during the appreciation day.</p>
            <br>As a CSP member I have done 3 main activities:
            <li>Tutoring: I have gone to Iberekodo for tutoring</li>
            <li>Sports: This is my main role in CSP and recently in the sports department I have been involve in the first ever inter-house sports as seen in the images</li>
            <li>CSP's first-ever Beach-Cleaning:In the first semester I cleaned the beach with 11 other members.</li>

            <h3>Project 3: Video creation</h3>
            <p>One thing you might notice is that I like putting smiles on people's faces. One way I like doing that is making video messages for them on their special day or when they least expected. One thing about this form of creation is that I can add the literary art (poetry) to it in the video messages.
                <br>
                I recently got a milestone certificate from Canva, as seen in the right.
